## Talks
 
### Frameworks for UX Thinking - Todd Sieling

Spend just a few years as a UX practitioner and it's easy to wonder if you'll ever have a handle on things. Tools, practices, and of course, technologies, keep changing. After a while you'll wonder if anyone can ever keep up.

Techniques come and go, but how we think about UX can lift a practice above the churn and guide us day to day throughout a career. This talk will discuss the importance of finding a framework for thinking through UX problems, and how doing so prepares us for a future of rapidly expanding possibility.

 
### Designing Under The Agile Fog of War - James Bryant

It's challenging to work iteratively while still mapping out the bigger picture. As a designer on an Agile development team, it's common to feel conflicted between 'shipping it' and understanding the larger problem you're trying to solve.

In this talk, we'll look at the current state of Mobify's design processes and how we balance designing for the long term vision of our products while continuing to ship iterations as quickly as possible. We'll also look at some of the little things we do to ensure we are making meaningful design decisions without compromising the fast pace of our production cycles.
