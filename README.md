## What is Style & Class?

Style & Class is a community for the designers and developers who build the web.

It's for designers who want to learn and share new techniques from concept all the way to execution. It's for front-end developers who want to talk shop about HTML, CSS, and creating great experiences. Most importantly, it's for people to get involved in conversations about cutting edge design methods, brand new development techniques, and brilliant experiments in user theory and interaction strategies.

We aim to offer conference-quality talks and panels in a casual environmentâ€”along with enough interesting craft beer to keep you in your seat. Our talks are targeted at industry professionals, but we welcome people of all skill levels who are passionate about improving the way we build the web.


## In this repo

This is our public Style &amp; Class Meetup Planning Documentation, warts and all.

Over time we expect this repo to contain all of our collective knowledge about planning Style & Class events. For now, it's a pitiful start but it's better than nothing.
