# A Platform

In addition to providing a great event for Vancouver web designers and developers, we want Style & Class to be a platform to elevate talented individuals and help them fine tune their public speaking skills to prepare for larger international audiences.

# Talk Selection Criteria

We aim to operate at a high level within the web design & development industry. To help that, we'd like to be transparent about our speaker selection criteria so those who submit talks are fully in the know about what makes for a good S&C talk. We don't expect a talk to meet every point, but here are some of the questions we'll ask:

* Is the topic relevant and interesting to professionals working in our industry?
* Does this talk contribute new knowledge to our field?
* Does the speaker provide a unique perspective on the topic?
* Is this talk a veiled product pitch? ()A good answer is no.)
* Is the speaker a past attendee of our meetup, have they demonstrated an understanding of the level of talks we try to cultivate?
* (this needs so much work)

# Providing Assistance

As event organizers, we will provide speaking coaching to our upcoming speakers. The benefits are three-fold:

* Fine tune the talks to make sure they fit our audience
* Help our peers develop strong speaking/presentation skills
* Help ourselves develop our own mentoring skills

To do this, we want to help speakers through:

1. The process of developing a topic
2. Working on an outline
3. Fleshing out their speaking points
4. Putting together a great slide deck
5. And providing a forum for practicing

Helping a speaker out with their scheduling is a great start. Check out this email template we recently sent to one of our speakers:


> Hey (insert speaker name),
> 
> Thought I'd send a quick email update and let you know what our next steps are. So we're almost exactly 6 weeks out (March 11th event date) and here's how I thought our schedule could work:
>
> * Week 1 - Topic - flesh out the talk title and a brief summary
> * Week 2 - Outline - develop a rough outline of the talk
> * Week 4 - Slides - start putting together slide deck and doing soft run throughs
> * Week 6 - Practice - practice, practice, practice! We can have you come in to Mobify and do a run through for our lunch & learn program.
> So that kinda outlines things. I'm here to help you guys through all stages of the process, so if you guys have any questions and/or concerns just fire me a message.

# Preparing a Talk

We really like [http://speaking.io/](http://speaking.io/) as a resource for speakers, first time and experienced alike. It reflects a lot of tips and tricks learned the hard way, and is a great way of shortcutting some of the common beginner mistakes.

# Developing a Topic

* Choose a topic you're excited about. A bad presenter with passion is more interesting than a polished presenter who has checked out.
* Choose a topic you're knowledgeable about.

# Practice

We want our speakers to appear confident and experienced onstage. Offer to help the speaker practice their run throughs. Its incredibly important for practice runs to be spoken at full volume at normal speed, as practicing while whispering can negatively impact a speakers performance.

You can also offer to have the speaker come in practice at a Mobify Lunch & Learn. Talk to Mobify Ops about scheduling the speaker the week before the Style and Class event. This will provide a comfortable practice environment in front of a real audience. Let the speaker know they can ask the audience for talk feedback during or at the end of their presentation.

# The Presentation

# Dealing with Q&A

* If you're lucky, every question will be well-formed and will tap into new information that you're comfortable addressing. 
* You may get questions you don't understand. It's okay to ask for clarification.
* You may get questions you don't know the answer to. It's okay to say that. ie. 'Wow, that was a great question, I don't know the answer to it off the top of my head, but let's chat more about it after.'
* You may get questions that are thinly-veiled marketing efforts. We frown on these, and it's okay for you to not answer the question by asking the person to talk to you privately about it.

# Online Courses
* edX, the online school developed by MIT, has an excellent online course for public speaking.
* Introduction to Public Speaking - Dr. Matt McGarrity is a Senior Lecturer in the Communication Department at the University of Washington.
* "This course is designed to help you become a more effective and confident public speaker. We will demystify the process of writing, practicing, and performing a clear and engaging speech, work through the unique traits of oral versus written communication, and learn how to prepare speeches that are easier to deliver orally and understand aurally."
