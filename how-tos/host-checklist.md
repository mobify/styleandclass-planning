# Host Checklist

## Two Weeks Before

* determine budget
* rent chairs / any other equipment
* book interpreter if necessary - talk to Cole about volunteers from Douglas College
* inform Mobify Ops of event date so they can put it in the Mobify Events calendar

## One Week Before

* Prep background slide with logo and hashtag, wifi details - Download MC Slides Template
* Email speakers to remind them they agreed to speak, ask if there's anything they need. Here's a template you can use:
 
> "We're one week out from the next Style & Class, and I for one am really excited to come hear your tips for (insert topic here).
>
> I wanted to check in and see if you have any requests or anything you'll need next week when giving your talk? We're assuming you'll bring your own laptop and have a video out cable that can connect to the projector, but we'll try to have a few adapters on hand just in case. Otherwise we'll have all the standard AV stuff, so if you need any extra gear or support now would be a great time to let me know about it.
>
> And if you have any other questions, let me know. See you next Tuesday!"

## Day Before

* Send out reminder email to meetup group - refer to this template
* Remind attendees to change RSVP to NO to open up waiting list spots
* Contact Joe Palmer at CRAFT to reserve a few tables for apres - https://twitter.com/JoeAtCBM â€“ or not, we don't like CRAFT anymore. Let's use Tap & Barrel, contact is village@tapandbarrel.com

## Day Of Prep

* You'll probably find the checklists handy: Checklists - Supplies and MC Responsibilities
* Send out one last tweet reminding people to RSVP if they're not coming and free up spots
* Print out name tags generated by meetup.com noon or so. You may need to make an emergency trip to Staples to get more nametag templates.
	* Speakers may not have RSVPed for the event, you may need to print name tags for them

* Get ice for the beer
* Setup both recycling and general waste bins
* Put out name tags, sharpies

## During the Event

* MC notes from 2nd event are available here, and 3rd event here.
* Greet speakers when they arrive
* Test A/V setup
	* Do they need audio?
	* Do they need adapters?
	* Do they have a backup plan if their clicker / phone shuts down halfway through? Make sure presenter notes are on their display, and their presentation isn't mirrored
* Tell each speaker when they're on, and tell them how Q&A will work
* Announce event hashtag, wifi, bathroom locations

## After the Event

* Calculate attendance
	* use unused nametags to change attendance on meetup.com

	* for people that left RSVP to yes and didn't arrive - set as "no-show"
	* attendance numbers will change to reflect

## Keep an eye on...

* At the start, have a plan for quieting everyone down to kick things off
* Make sure random people aren't wandering around the venue
* Know where your speakers are at time-wise, and have a system for letting them know they're taking too long
